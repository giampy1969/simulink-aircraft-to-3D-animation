This block allows the use of aeronautics conventions to express orientation and position of an object in a virtual world.
Specifically, the object's orientation can be expressed by means of euler angles and its position by means of X,Y,and H cartesian coordinates.

This block was created in October 2002, since then there is probably a built-in block somewhere that accomplishes the same task.
